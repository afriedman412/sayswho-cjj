June 22--     Jun. 22--Police reform and racial injustice were key topics discussed between Aiken\'s local leaders and South Carolina\'s senior senator during a Monday morning roundtable discussion.\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., met with law enforcement and local religious and city leaders at the Lessie B. Price Senior and Youth Center where discussions began around 10:30 a.m.\nHis visit to Aiken follows weeks of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while his hands were cuffed behind his back.\n"Enough is enough," Graham said, referring to Floyd\'s death. "There\'s almost unanimity that what happened to Mr. Floyd was not good policing. It\'s abusive policing. It\'s a stain on us as a nation. It needs to change."\nThroughout closed-door conversations, local leaders told Graham the issues with racism both in the Aiken community and the nation.\nGraham briefly spoke on his own realization of the different races\' experiences with law enforcement through conversations with Tim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina.\nHe said Scott, a Black man, has been stopped six or seven times on Capitol Hill while Graham said he\'s never been stopped.\n"Black lives matter," Graham said.

Sometime in the afternoon of Nov. 3, 1966, West Anchorage High School senior William Michael "Mike" Christian left his parents\' home at 4306 North Star Road for the last time. After running some errands, he visited the Sundowner Drive-In theater off the Seward Highway near Chester Creek. After probably several mosquito bites, he stopped to call his girlfriend on the way out. According to her, he seemed in a good mood. He was going to wash his car, attend a car club meeting, and be home well before midnight. He hung up and then vanished.\nHe never made it to the car club or home. His parents did not worry about his absence at first, assuming he spent the night with friends. However, they grew instantly concerned when his beloved 1963 Impala sedan was discovered the next day, abandoned in town. By Nov. 6, the Alaska State Police, now the Alaska State Troopers, were actively investigating his disappearance. One officer was assigned near exclusively to the case.\nThe parents ran advertisements in the local newspapers offering a $500 reward, about $4,000 in 2021.

Russian troops, he added, were "tracking down" people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian troops occupying parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south of terrorizing civilians and hunting for anyone who served in Ukraine\'s military or government.\n"The occupiers think this will make it easier for them to control this territory. But they are very wrong. They are fooling themselves," Zelenskyy said. "Russia\'s problem is that it is not accepted - and never will be accepted - by the entire Ukrainian people. Russia has lost Ukraine forever."\nIn his nightly video address to the nation, Zelenskyy also said he discussed the fate of Mariupol with top military and intelligence officials. He said he couldn\'t offer details, "but we are doing everything we can to save our people.\'\'\nZelenskyy said peace and "how many more Ukrainians the occupiers have time to kill\'\' depend on Ukraine receiving more outside support, and echoed calls for more and faster military aid, as well as an oil embargo on Russia.
