U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., met with law enforcement and local religious and city leaders at the Lessie B. Price Senior and Youth Center where discussions began around 10:30 a.m.\nHis visit to Aiken follows weeks of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while his hands were cuffed behind his back. "Enough is enough," Graham said, referring to Floyd\'s death. "There\'s almost unanimity that what happened to Mr. Floyd was not good policing. It\'s abusive policing. It\'s a stain on us as a nation. It needs to change." Throughout closed-door conversations, local leaders told Graham the issues with racism both in the Aiken community and the nation.\nGraham briefly spoke on his own realization of the different races\' experiences with law enforcement through conversations with Tim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina. He said Scott, a Black man, has been stopped six or seven times on Capitol Hill while Graham said he\'s never been stopped. "Black lives matter," Graham said.""",

His parents did not worry about his absence at first, assuming he spent the night with friends. However, they grew instantly concerned when his beloved 1963 Impala sedan was discovered the next day, abandoned in town. By Nov. 6, the Alaska State Police, now the Alaska State Troopers, were actively investigating his disappearance. One officer was assigned near exclusively to the case.
